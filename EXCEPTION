This file describes the limits of the Exception under which you are
allowed to distribute Non-GPL in linked combination with the Directory
Server.  For the full text of the license, please see one of the
header files included with the source distribution or the file LICENSE
found in the top level directory of the source.

Permitted interfaces include:

* ldap/servers/slapd/slapi-plugin.h

This header file defines a set of interfaces that allow you to build
shared libraries that the Directory Server can load at run time.  As
long as those plugins only link to the Directory Server code via those
interfaces listed in slapi-plugin.h, and any header files that are
part of the header file dependency chain for slapi-plugin.h, your code
falls under the Exception defined in the Directory Server License.
