.SH NAME 
dbmon.sh - Directory Server script for monitoring database and entry cache usage
.SH SYNOPSIS
[INCR=num] [HOST=hostname] [PORT=num] [BINDDN=binddn] [BINDPW=password] [DBLIST=databases] [INDEXLIST=indexes] [VERBOSE=num] dbmon.sh
.SH DESCRIPTION
dbmon.sh is a tool used to monitor database and entry cache usage. It is especially useful for database cache and entry/dn cache tuning - how much space is left, is the cache full, how much space on average do I need per entry/dn.
.SH OPTIONS
It doesn't take any command line arguments, so all options must be passed in as environment variables.

dbmon.sh will loop repeatedly showing the db information until it is killed or Ctrl-C

All arguments are optional, but you will most likely have to provide BINDPW
