.SH NAME
migrate\-ds.pl \- Directory Server Migration script
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B migrate\-ds.pl 
[\-\-options] \fB\-\-\fR [args]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Directory Server Migration script - migrates Directory Server from
older releases to the current release.
.PP
This script will copy instances (data and configuration) from the old
server root directory to their new FHS locations.  This script does a
copy only \- the data in the old instances will be left untouched.  The
old instances must be shutdown first to ensure that the databases are
copied safely.  During migration your migrated instances will be started.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below:
.TP
.B \fB\-\-help\fR
This message
.TP
.B \fB\-\-version\fR
Print the version and exit
.TP
.B \fB\-\-debug\fR
Turn on debugging
.TP
.B \fB\-\-oldsroot\fR
The old server root directory to migrate from
.TP
.B \fB\-\-actualsroot\fR This is the old location of the old server root.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-silent\fR
Use silent setup \- no user input
.TP
.B \fB\-\-file\fR=\fIname\fR
Use the file 'name' in .inf format to supply the
default answers
.TP
.B \fB\-\-keepcache\fR
Do not delete the temporary .inf file generated by
this program
.TP
.B \fB\-\-logfile\fR
Log migration messages to this file \- otherwise, a temp
file will be used
.TP
.B \fB\-\-instance\fR
By default, all directory server instances will be
migrated.  You can use this argument to specify one
or more (e.g. \fB\-i\fR slapd\-foo \fB\-i\fR slapd\-bar) if you do
not want to migrate all of them.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cross\fR
See below.
.PP
For all options, you can also use the short name e.g. \fB\-h\fR, \fB\-d\fR, etc.
For the \fB\-d\fR argument, specifying it more than once will increase the
debug level e.g. \fB\-ddddd\fR
.PP
args:
You can supply default .inf data in this format:
.IP
section.param=value
.PP
e.g.
.IP
General.FullMachineName=foo.example.com
.PP
or
.IP
"slapd.Suffix=dc=example, dc=com"
.PP
Values passed in this manner will override values in an .inf file
given with the \fB\-f\fR argument.
.PP
actualsroot:
This is used when you must migrate from one machine to another.  The
usual case is that you have mounted the old server root on a different
root directory, either via a network mount, or by copying a tarball
made using a relative directory on the source machine to the
destination machine and untarring it.
.PP
For example: machineA is a 32bit machine, and you want to migrate your
servers to a new 64bit machine.  Lets assume your old server root on
machineA was /opt/myds, and your new machine also wants to use a
server root of /opt/myds.  There are a couple of different ways to
proceed.  Either make a tarball of opt/myds from machineA using a
relative path (i.e. NOT /opt/myds) or use NFS to mount
machineA:/opt/myds on a different mount point
(e.g. machineB:/migration/opt/myds).
.PP
If you do this, you should give the old "real" server root (/opt/myds)
as the \fB\-\-actualsroot\fR argument, and use /migration/opt/myds for the
\fB\-\-oldsroot\fR argument.  That is, the oldsroot is the physical location of
the files on disk.  The actualsroot is the old value of the server root
on the source machine.
.PP
cross:
Also known as crossplatform, or 'c', or 'x'.
This is when the source machine is a different architecture than the
destination machine.  In this case, only certain data will be available
for migration.  Changelog information will not be migrated, and replicas
will need to be reinitialized (if migrating masters or hubs).  This type
of migration requires that all of your old databases have been dumped
to LDIF format, and the LDIF file must be in the default database directory
(usually /opt/fedora\-ds/slapd\-instance/db), and the LDIF file must have
the same name as the database instance directory, with a ".ldif".  For
example, if you have
.IP
.ad l
.nf
/opt/fedora\-ds/slapd\-instance/db/userRoot/
and
/opt/fedora\-ds/slapd\-instance/db/NetscapeRoot/
.na
.fi
.PP
you must first use db2ldif to export these databases to LDIF e.g.
.IP
.ad l
.nf
cd /opt/fedora\-ds/slapd\-instance
\&./db2ldif \fB\-n\fR userRoot \fB\-a\fR /opt/fedora\-ds/slapd\-instance/db/userRoot.ldif and
\&./db2ldif \fB\-n\fR NetscapeRoot \fB\-a\fR /opt/fedora\-ds/slapd\-instance/db/NetscapeRoot.ldif
.fi
.na
.PP
Then you must somehow make your old server root directory available on
the destination machine, either by creating a tar archive on the source
and copying it to the destination, or by network mounting the source
directory on the destination machine.
