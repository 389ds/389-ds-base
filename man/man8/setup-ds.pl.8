.SH NAME
setup\-ds.pl \- Set up an instance of Directory Server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B setup-ds.pl
[\fI--options\fR] \fI-- \fR[\fIargs\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Set up a Directory Server instance.  Creates the configuration
files for an instance of Directory Server based on a few parameters
like the hostname, port number, and directory manager information.
Can be run in interactive mode with different levels of verbosity, or
in silent mode with parameters supplied in a .inf format file or
on the command line.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below:
.TP
.B \fB\-\-help\fR
This message
.TP
.B \fB\-\-version\fR
Print the version and exit
.TP
.B \fB\-\-debug\fR
Turn on debugging
.TP
.B \fB\-\-silent\fR
Use silent setup \- no user input
.TP
.B \fB\-\-file\fR=\fIname\fR
Use the file 'name' in .inf format to supply the default answers
.TP
.B \fB\-\-keepcache\fR
Do not delete the temporary .inf file generated by this program
.TP
.B \fB\-\-logfile\fR
Log setup messages to this file \- otherwise, a temp file will be used
.TP
.B \fB\-\-update\fR
Update existing installations \- add/update schema files, add/change configuration, add new instance scripts, etc. You must run setup-ds.pl \-u after upgrading your packages.  You will usually have to restart your servers in order for all of the changes to take effect (e.g. adding/changing plug-in configuration), so schedule this when you can afford a little downtime.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-continue\fR
(Update only) Keep going even if errors occur.  You will usually not need to use this option unless your installation is broken and you need to force it to update in order to fix it.
.PP
For all options, you can also use the short name e.g. \fB\-h\fR, \fB\-d\fR, etc.  For the \fB\-d\fR argument,
specifying it more than once will increase the debug level e.g. \fB\-ddddd\fR
.PP
args:
You can supply default .inf data in this format:
.IP
section.param=value
.PP
e.g.
.IP
General.FullMachineName=foo.example.com
.PP
or
.IP
"slapd.Suffix=dc=example, dc=com"
.PP
Values passed in this manner will override values in an .inf file given with the \fB\-f\fR argument.
.SH UPDATES
The update process (setup-ds.pl \-u) can work in one of two modes:

\fBOnline\fR: Configuration changes are made to the running directory servers
using LDAP.  The operations must be performed as an administrative
user.  You must provide the name and password, for each instance if
there is more than one instance of directory server. Some changes (e.g. plug-ins)
may require a directory server restart to take effect.  The update
script will notify you if a restart is required.

\fBOffline\fR: The changes are made to the server configuration files.
The servers \fBMUST FIRST BE SHUTDOWN BY YOU\fR.  The script will not
shutdown the servers for you.  \fBYou MUST\fR shutdown the servers in order
to use this mode.  A username and password are not required to use
Offline mode.  If the servers are not shutdown, \fBCHANGES WILL BE LOST\fR.

To summarize:

Online \- servers remain running - you must provide admin name and password for each server - servers may need to be restarted

Offline \- servers \fBmust be shutdown\fR - no username or password required
