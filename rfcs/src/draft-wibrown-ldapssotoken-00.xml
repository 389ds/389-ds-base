      <t>LDAP Single Sign On Token is a SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer
        <xref target="RFC2222" format="default">RFC 2222</xref>) mechanism to allow single sign-on to an LDAP
        Directory Server environment. Tokens generated by the LDAP server can be transmitted through other
        protocols and channels, allowing a broad range of clients and middleware to take advantage
        of single sign-on in environments where Kerberos v5 or other Single Sign On mechanisms may not be avaliable.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The need for new, simple single sign-on capable systems has arisen
        with the development of new technologies and systems. For these systems
        we should be able to provide a simple, localised and complete single
        sign-on service. This does not aim to replace Kerberos V5. It is designed for when Kerberos
        is too invasive for installation in an environment.
      </t>
      <t>Tokens generated by this system should be able to be transmitted over
        different protocols allowing middleware to relay tokens to clients.
        Clients can then contact the middleware natively and the middleware can
        negotiate the client authentication with the LDAP server.</t>
      <!-- Use terms to describe instead -->
        <t>This implementation will provide an LDAP extended operation to create
        tokens which a client may cache, or relay to a further client. The token
        can then be sent in a SASL bind request to the LDAP server. The token
        remains valid over many binds. Finally, Tokens
        for a client are always able to be revoked at the LDAP Server using an
        LDAP extended operation, allowing global
        logout by the user or administrator.</t>

      <t>This document has two components. A SASL Mechanism, and LDAP extended operations.</t>
      <t>There is no strict requirement for the two to coexist: The LDAP Operation
        is an implementation of the service providing tokens, and the SASL Mechanism to authenticate them.</t>
      <t>In theory, an alternate protocol and database could generate and authenticate these tokens.</t>

      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Token formats</name>
        <t>Token formats are server implementation specific: As they
            are the only entity that will decrypt and consume them, they have
            the option to provide these in any format they wish. </t>
        <t>This means the client will only see an opaque data structure, and will only
            need to transmit this opaque structure as part of the authentication request.</t>
        <t>For the token system to operate correctly the server MUST
            generate tokens that contain at least these three values:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Date Time Issued</li>
          <li>Date Time Until</li>
          <li>User Unique Id</li>
        </ul>
        <t>As the client does not ever see the contents the User Unique Id can be
            anything within the database that uniquely identifies the user
            that is the holder of the token.</t>
        <t>The User Unique Id MUST be an UTF8 String.</t>
        <t>The token format MUST be encrypted. The token format can be
            decrypted with either a asymmetric or symmetric keying system. </t>
        <t>The token format MUST have a form of data authentication.
            This can be through authenticated encryption, or validation of a hash.</t>
        <t>The Date Time Issued MUST be a complete timestamp in UTC, to
            prevent issues with changing timezones.</t>
        <t>Without these guarantees, the token system is not secure,
            and is vulnerable to credential forgery attacks.</t>
        <t>Here is an EXAMPLE ASN.1 format that would be encrypted and
            sent to the client:</t>
        <figure anchor="asn_token_example">

    UserUniqueId   UTF8String }
                ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>This would be encrypted with AES-GCM and transmitted to the
            client.</t>
        <!-- make this an xref -->
            <t>Another example would be to use a fernet token
            <xref target="FERNETSPEC" format="default">Fernet Specification</xref>.</t>

                ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>Timestamp can be considered to be the DateTimeIssued as:</t>
        <t>"This field is a 64-bit unsigned big-endian integer. It records
            the number of seconds elapsed between January 1, 1970 UTC and the
            time the token was created."</t>
        <t>We can then create a Cipher text containing:</t>
        <figure anchor="fernet_tokendata_example">
          <artwork align="left" name="" type="" alt=""><![CDATA[
Date Time Until || User Unique Id
                ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>The Date Time Until is a 64-bit unsigned big-endian integer. It is,
            like Date Time Issued, the number of seconds since January 1, 1970
            UTC, and the token creation time added to the number of seconds of
            the requested life time. </t>
        <t>This example format satisfies all of our data requirements for the sso token
            system.</t>

        <name>SASL Client</name>
        <t>The client will request a token from the authentication server.
            The acquisition method for the token is discussed in section XXX.</t>
        <t>For authentication, the client MUST send the token as it was received.
            IE changes to formatting are not permitted.</t>
        <t>The client MUST send the an appropriate authid in  <xref target="RFC2078" format="default">RFC 2078</xref>
            form. This authid MUST internally match the User Unique Id in the token. The server
            is responsible for this validation.</t>
        <t>The client MAY transform the token if acting in a proxy fashion.
            However this transformation must be deterministic and able to be
            reversed to satisfy the previous requirement.</t>

        <t>This example shows how a client is issued with a token when
            communicating with a web server via the HTTP intermediate. The Client
            does not need to be aware of the SASL/LDAP system in the background,
            or the token's formatting rules. Provided the HTTP server in
            proxy, if required to transform the token, is able to undo the
            transformations, this is a valid scenario. For example, HTML escaping
            a base64 token.</t>

        <t>The client issues a SASL bind request with the mechanism name

        <t>The client sends an appropriate authid in  <xref target="RFC2078" format="default">RFC 2078</xref>
            form.</t>
        <t>The client provides the encrypted token that was provided in
            the LDAPSSOTokenResponse Token Field.</t>
        <t>The token is decrypted and authenticated based on the token
            format selected by the server. The server MAY attempt multiple
            token keys and or formats to find the correct issuing format and
            key.</t>
        <t>If the token decryption fails, the attempt with this key and
            format MUST be considered to fail.</t>
        <t>If the values have been tampered with, IE hash authentication fails, the attempt with the key
            and format MUST be considered to fail. </t>
        <t>The token decryption MUST return a valid DateTimeUntil,

            if the authid is william@EXAMPLE.COM, the server maps this to an identity. Once this
