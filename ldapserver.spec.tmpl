@COMPANY-PRODUCT-NAME@ is an LDAPv3 compliant server.

# wait! what's going on here?  where are the prep and build sections?
# what kind of a .spec file is this anyway?
# A: one that works well with the current DS build system
# As we move towards a completely open source build
# process, will begin doing things in the more RPM way
# but for now, in order to make our tight deadlines and
# support RHN distribution, this is the way we do it

# into the BuildRoot
# the echo yes is for dsktune to continue
