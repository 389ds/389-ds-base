%description
@COMPANY-PRODUCT-NAME@ is an LDAPv3 compliant server.

# prep and setup expect there to be a Source0 file
# in the SOURCES directory - it will be unpacked
# in the _builddir (not BuildRoot)
%prep
%setup

%build
# This will do a regular make build and make pkg
# including grabbing the admin server, setup, etc.
# The resultant zip files and setup program will
# be in ldapserver/pkg
# INSTDIR is relative to ldap/cm
# build the file structure to package under ldapserver/pkg
# instead of MM.DD/platform
# remove BUILD_DEBUG=optimize to build the debug version
# INTERNAL_BUILD=1 uses the internal, proprietary packages
# like setupsdk, adminsdk, admin server
# BUILD_MODE=int builds the Redhat branded product
BUILDMODE=@BUILD-MODE@
if [ $BUILDMODE = int ]; then
# brandDirectory makes the product use Redhat branded text and graphics
	make brandDirectory
fi

%install
# all we do here is run setup -b to unpack the binaries
# into the BuildRoot
rm -rf $RPM_BUILD_ROOT
cd pkg
# the echo yes is for dsktune to continue
echo yes | ./setup -b $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/%{prefix}
# this is our setup script that sets up the initial
# server instances after installation
cd ..

rm -rf $RPM_BUILD_ROOT

%files
# rather than listing individual files, we just package (and own)
# the entire ldapserver directory - if we change this to put
# files in different places, we won't be able to do this anymore
