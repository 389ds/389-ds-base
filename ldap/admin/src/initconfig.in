# This file is sourced by @package_name@ upon startup to set
# the default environment for all directory server instances.
# To set instance specific defaults, make a copy of this
# file in the same directory called @package_name@-instance
# where "instance" is the name of your directory server
# instance e.g. @package_name@-localhost for the
# slapd-localhost instance

# In order to make more file descriptors available
# to the directory server, first make sure the system
# hard limits are raised, then use ulimit - uncomment
# out the following line and change the value to the
# desired value
# ulimit -n 8192

# In order to use SASL/GSSAPI the directory
# server needs to know where to find its keytab
# file - uncomment the following line and set
# the path and filename appropriately
# KRB5_KTNAME=@instconfigdir@/slapd-instance/keytab ; export KRB5_KTNAME

# other environment settings can be added here too
