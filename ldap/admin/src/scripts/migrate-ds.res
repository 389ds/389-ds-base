end_ds_migration = Directory server migration is complete.  Please check output and log files for details.\n
migration_exiting = Exiting . . .\nLog file is '%s'\n\n
instance_already_exists = The target directory server instance already exists at %s.  Skipping migration.  Note that if you want to migrate the old instance you will have to first remove the new one of the same name.\n\n

error_reading_olddbconfig = Could not read the old database configuration information.  Error: %s\n
error_migrating_schema = Could not copy old schema file '%s'.  Error: %s\n
error_opening_schema = Could not open new schema file '%s'.  Error: %s\n
error_schema_permissions = Could not reset permissions on schema file '%s'.  Error: %s\n

error_copying_dbfile = Could not copy database file '%s' to '%s'.  Error: %s\n
error_dbsrcdir_not_exist = Could not copy from the database source directory '%s' because it does not exist.  Please check your configuration.\n
error_no_instances = Could not find any instances in the old directory '%s' to migrate.\n
error_removing_temp_db_files = Could not remove the temporary db files in '%s' to clear the directory in preparation for the migrated db files.  Error: %s\n
error_copying_certdb = Could not copy the certificate database file '%s' to '%s'.  Error: %s\n
error_copying_keydb = Could not copy the private key database file '%s' to '%s'.  Error: %s\n
error_copying_secmoddb = Could not copy the security module database file '%s' to '%s'.  Error: %s\n

error_copying_certmap = Could not copy the client certificate mapping file '%s' to '%s'.  Error: %s\n
ldif_required_for_cross_platform = No LDIF files were found in %s.\n
LDIF files are required in order to do cross platform migration.  The\
database files are not binary compatible, and the new databases must\
be initialized from an LDIF export of the old databases.  Please refer\
to the migration instructions for help with how to do this.\n\n
fixing_integer_attr_index = The index for the attribute '%s' in the database directory '%s' will be removed and re-created.\n\n
error_removing_index_file = Could not remove the index file '%s'.  Error: %s\n\n
error_recreating_index_file = Could not re-create the index file '%s'.  Error: %s\n\n
error_reading_dbversion = Could not read the old database version information from '%s'.  Error: %s\n\n
error_database_too_old = The database at '%s' is too old to be migrated as a binary copy.  You must export to LDIF.\n\n
This version cannot be migrated using the database binaries.  You must\
first convert the databases to LDIF format and use the cross platform\
migration procedure.  This procedure is documented in the migration\
guide and in the help for this script.\n\n
