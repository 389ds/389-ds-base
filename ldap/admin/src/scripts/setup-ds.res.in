update_dialog_mode =\
The update process can work in one of two modes:\
\
  - Online: The changes are made to the running directory servers using LDAP.\
            The operations must be performed as an administrative user.\
            You must provide the name and password, for each instance\
            if there is more than one instance of directory server.\
            Some operations may require a directory server restart to take\
            effect.  The update script will notify you if you need to restart\
            the server.\
\
  - Offline: The changes are made to the server configuration files.  The\
             servers MUST FIRST BE SHUTDOWN BY YOU.  The script will not\
             shutdown the servers for you.  You MUST shutdown the\
             servers in order to use this mode.  A username and password\
             are not required to use Offline mode.  If the servers are not\
             shutdown, CHANGES WILL BE LOST.\
\
To summarize:\
  Online - servers remain running - you must provide admin name and password\
           for each server - servers may need to be restarted\
  Offline - servers must be shutdown - no username or password required\n\n
