# This perl module provides a way to set up a new installation after
# the binaries have already been extracted.  This is typically after
# using native packaging support to install the package e.g. RPM,
# pkgadd, depot, etc.  This script will show the license, readme,
# dsktune, then run the usual setup pre and post installers.
