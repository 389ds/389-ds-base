# This file is sourced by @package_name@ upon startup to set
# the default environment for all directory server instances.
# To set instance specific defaults, use the file in the same
# directory called @package_name@-instance where "instance"
# is the name of your directory server instance e.g.
# @package_name@-localhost for the slapd-localhost instance.

# In order to make more file descriptors available
# to the directory server, first make sure the system
# hard limits are raised, then use ulimit - uncomment
# out the following line and change the value to the
# desired value
# ulimit -n 8192
# note - if using systemd, ulimit won't work -  you must edit
# the systemd unit file for directory server to add the 
# LimitNOFILE option - see man systemd.exec for more info

# A per instance keytab does not make much sense for servers.
# Kerberos clients use the machine FQDN to obtain a ticket like ldap/FQDN, there
# is nothing that can make a client understand how to get a per-instance ticket.
# Therefore by default a keytab should be considered a per server option.

# Also this file is sourced for all instances, so again all
# instances would ultimately get the same keytab.

# Finally a keytab is normally named either krb5.keytab or <service>.keytab

# In order to use SASL/GSSAPI (Kerberos) the directory
# server needs to know where to find its keytab
# file - uncomment the following line and set
# the path and filename appropriately
# if using systemd, omit the "; export VARNAME" at the end
# KRB5_KTNAME=@instconfigdir@/myname.keytab ; export KRB5_KTNAME

# how many seconds to wait for the startpid file to show
# up before we assume there is a problem and fail to start
# if using systemd, omit the "; export VARNAME" at the end
#STARTPID_TIME=10 ; export STARTPID_TIME
# how many seconds to wait for the pid file to show
# up before we assume there is a problem and fail to start
# if using systemd, omit the "; export VARNAME" at the end
#PID_TIME=600 ; export PID_TIME
