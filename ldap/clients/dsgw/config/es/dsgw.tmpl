# Or, this default may be overridden for a specific language, by creating

# with a charset parameter in the content-type, comment out this directive;

# Mapping between config/display-XXX.html templates and LDAP objectClasses.
# This can be generated by using ds/templateindex.  The format is:
#
#    template TEMPLATENAME  OBJECTCLASSES
#
# where "display-TEMPLATENAME.html" is the name of a display template
# that is found in this config directory (e.g., "display-group.html") and
# OBJECTCLASSES is a list of one or more objectClass values.  For a given
# template to be used, all the objectClass values listed must be present
# in the directory entry, so the order of these template lines is
# significant (e.g. note that the more specific "orgperson" template is
# listed before the one for an ordinary "person").

# The remainder of this file contains information about the locations and
# types for new entries.
#
# "location" lines define places in the directory where new entries can be added
# The format of each line is:
#	location HANDLE FRIENDLYNAME DN
# where HANDLE is a short name which is used in the "newtype" lines (see below)
# and FRIENDLYNAME is a human-readable name for the location
# and DN is the Distinguished Name for this location (if it does not end with
#   '#', the location-suffix is appended to to construct a full DN; if it
#   does end with `#', it assumed to be a full DN and the `#' is removed).
#

location  people	"Personas"		"ou=People"

# "newtype" lines define the types of new entries that may be added
# The format of each line is:
#	newtype TEMPLATENAME FRIENDLYNAME RDNATTR LOCATIONS...
# where TEMPLATENAME corresponds to an existing display-TEMPLATENAME.html file
# and FRIENDLYNAME is a human-readable name for this type of entry
# and RDNATTR is the attribute that is used to name entries of this type
# and LOCATIONS is a blank-separated list of locations where these types of
#    entries can be added (corresponding to a HANDLE on a "location"
#    config. file line).

# Mappings between VCard properties and LDAP attribute types:
# The format of each line is:
#	vcard-property VCARDPROP SYNTAX LDAPATTR [LDAPATTR2]
# where VCARDPROP is the name of a VCard property
# and SYNTAX is "cis" for simple strings and "mls" for multiline strings
# and LDAPATTR is the LDAP attribute that corresponds to VCARDPROP
# and LDAPATTR2 is an optional secondary LDAP attribute which is added to
#     the property value by appending a semicolon and then the attr2 value.
