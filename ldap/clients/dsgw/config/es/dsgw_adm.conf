# Mapping between config/display-XXX.html templates and LDAP objectClasses.
# This can be generated by using the templateindex program.  The format is:
#
#    template TEMPLATENAME  OBJECTCLASSES
#
# where "display-TEMPLATENAME.html" is the name of a display template
# that is found in this config directory (e.g., "display-group.html") and
# OBJECTCLASSES is a list of one or more objectClass values.  For a given
# template to be used, all the objectClass values listed must be present
# in the directory entry, so the order of these template lines is
# significant (e.g. note that the more specific "orgperson" template is
# listed before the one for an ordinary "person").
#
template  group		groupOfNames
template  groupun	groupOfUniqueNames

template  orgunit	organizationalUnit
template  orgperson	person  inetOrgPerson
