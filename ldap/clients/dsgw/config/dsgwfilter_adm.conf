# The <desc> should describe the filter.  It should correctly complete

# DBT_Found1EntryWhere_ and DBT_FoundEntriesWhere_; for example (en):
#
#	Found 1 entry where the  <desc> '%v'.
#	Found no entries where the  <desc> '%v'.
#	Found 3 entries where the  <desc> '%v'.
#
# The <desc> should begin with the article ("the" in English) for
# languages that require agreement between article and noun (e.g
# genders in Spanish or French).
#
# The scope is optional, and should be one of:
#	"base"
#	"onelevel"
#	"subtree"
