# The baseurl directive gives the server, port, and base dn where searches
# should be rooted.  The format is:
#
# ldap://host.domain[:port]/basedn
#  - or -
# ldaps://host.domain:port/basedn  (for SSL)
#
# Where:
# - "host.domain" is the fully-qualified domain name of the directory server
# - "port" is the port used by the directory server.  If you are using an
#   "ldaps" URL (that is, if the gateway is using SSL to communicate with the
#   directory server), then the port number is required.  Otherwise, it is
#   optional and defaults to the standard LDAP port (389).
# - "basedn" is the distinguished name of the place in the directory tree
#   where searches should start.  Typically, this is the same as the
#   "suffix" directive in your slapd.conf file.
#
# examples:
#  baseurl "ldap://mars.aceindustry.com/o=Ace Industry, c=US"
#   - causes the gateway to use the directory server running on host
#     "mars.aceindustry.com".  Since no port was given, the default LDAP
#     port (389) is used.  Searches in the gateway search for entries
#     contained within o=Ace Industry, c=US.
#
#  baseurl "ldaps://mars.aceindustry.com:636/o=Ace Industry, c=US"
#   - same as above, but uses SSL to connect to the directory server,
#     and contacts the server on port 636.

# The dirmgr directive specifies the "Manager" DN for your directory.
dirmgr	  "cn=Directory Manager, o=Netscape Communications Corp., c=US"

# The securitypath directive gives the full path name to your

# If the requireauth directive is present, users must authenticate to the
# directory before they may perform any operations.  XXX: not implemented
# in 1.0b2.

# The authlifetime directive specifies how long authentication credentials
# are valid (in seconds).

# The default character set, for communication with HTTP clients.
# A client may override this default, using an HTTP Accept-Charset header.
# Or, this default may be overridden for a specific language, by creating
# a LANG/dsgwcharset.conf file which contains the charset name.
# For compatibility with HTTP clients that can't handle an HTTP response
# with a charset parameter in the content-type, comment out this directive;
# responses will be sent in ISO-8859-1, with no explicit charset parameter.
# RFC 1345 defines the syntax of charset names.  There is a registry of
# charsets, at ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-sets
# charset UTF-8

# Mapping between config/display-XXX.html templates and LDAP objectClasses.
# This can be generated by using ds/templateindex.  The format is:
#
#    template TEMPLATENAME  OBJECTCLASSES
#
# where "display-TEMPLATENAME.html" is the name of a display template
# that is found in this config directory (e.g., "display-group.html") and
# OBJECTCLASSES is a list of one or more objectClass values.  For a given
# template to be used, all the objectClass values listed must be present
# in the directory entry, so the order of these template lines is
# significant (e.g. note that the more specific "umperson" and
# "orgperson" templates are listed before the one for an ordinary "person").
#

# The remainder of this file contains information about the locations and
# types for new entries.
#
# "location" lines define places in the directory where new entries can be added
# The format of each line is:
#	location HANDLE FRIENDLYNAME DN
# where HANDLE is a short name which is used in the "newtype" lines (see below)
# and FRIENDLYNAME is a human-readable name for the location
# and DN is the Distinguished Name for this location (if it does not end with
#   '#', the location-suffix is appended to to construct a full DN; if it
#   does end with `#', it assumed to be a full DN and the `#' is removed).
#

location  org		"現在の機関"	""
location  groups	"機関グループ"	"ou=Groups"
location  acct		"経理"		"ou=Accounting"
location  hr		"人事"	"ou=Human Resources"
location  pay		"会計"		"ou=Payroll"
location  pd		"製品開発"	"ou=Product Development"
location  test		"製品テスト"	"ou=Product Testing"

# "newtype" lines define the types of new entries that may be added
# The format of each line is:
#	newtype TEMPLATENAME FRIENDLYNAME RDNATTR LOCATIONS...
# where TEMPLATENAME corresponds to an existing add-TEMPLATENAME.html file
# and FRIENDLYNAME is a human-readable name for this type of entry
# and RDNATTR is the attribute that is used to name entries of this type
# and LOCATIONS is a blank-separated list of locations where these types of
#    entries can be added (corresponding to a HANDLE on a "location"
#    config. file line).
