You are using the Directory Server Gateway.  This interface can be
used to search for, modify, and create entries that are stored in the Brandx Directory Server.
<P>
You are currently viewing the Standard Search screen, which provides an
easy and convenient way to search the directory.  Standard Search
examines what you type and automatically selects one or more methods
for searching the directory.  Enter a name, telephone number, user id,
or e-mail address in the Search For field and click the
Search button to quickly locate directory entries.  Click the Help
button if you need additional assistance.

<P>
The toolbar you see at the top of this window is always available when you
are using the Directory Server Gateway.  In addition to Standard Search,
you can click the other buttons to perform a variety of tasks.
If you want to modify your own directory entry, first search for it using
Standard or Advanced Search and then click the Edit Person button
within the entry display.

New Entry allows you to create new entries in the directory.  Depending
on how the system administrator has set up your directory you may need
to be granted special permission to add new entries.  If you are not sure, ask
your system administrator.

You use the authentication screens to log into and out of the directory.
You need to authenticate before you can modify or add entries to the
directory.  You may also need to authenticate before searching the
directory, if your system administrator requires it.
