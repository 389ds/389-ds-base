# The agentx-master setting defines how to communicate
# with the SNMP master agent using the AgentX protocol.
# The default is to use a UNIX domain socket.  If your
# master agent is listening on a tcp port for AgentX
# subagents, use a line like the following:
#
# agentx-master localhost:705
agentx-master /var/agentx/master

# The agent-logdir settings defines where the subagent
# will write it's logfile.
agent-logdir @localstatedir@/log/@package_name@

# The server setting specifies a Directory Server
# instance that you want to monitor. You must use one
# server setting for each Directory Server instance. The
# subagent requires at least one server setting to be
# specified. The server setting
# should be set to the name of the Directory Server
# instance you would like to monitor. For example:
# 
# server slapd-phonebook
# 
# To monitor multiple Directory Server instances,  add
# an additional server parameter for each instance:
# 
# server slapd-phonebook
# server slapd-example
# server slapd-directory
