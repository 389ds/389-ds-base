001
	This one is a very basic example of use of ldclt. It is based for
	the configuration part, on iPlanet DS 5.0 but should work with any
	kind of ldap server.

	- env.ksh	Environment and parameters.
	- config.ksh	Configure the server (create user and aci).
	- add.ksh	Add random entries.
	- add_incr.ksh	Add sequentialy numbered entries.
	- delete.ksh	Delete random entries.
	- search.ksh	Search random entries.

002
	Using the advanced feature of ldclt allowing to specify very complex
	objects, we will generate ldif files or add/search complex objects.
	* Use the name files delivered with ldclt.

	- env.ksh	Environment and parameters.
	- config.ksh	Configure the server (create user and aci, modify
			schema).
	- ofile		Description of the object that will be created.
	- ldif01.ksh	Create ldif file with incremental strings from file,
			one entry per line in the file Lastname.txt
	- ldif02.ksh	Create ldif file with incremental strings from file,
			150k entries in total.
