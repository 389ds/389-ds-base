                   ----------------------------
                      Sample Server Plug-Ins
                     for Directory Server 7
                   ----------------------------

This directory contains code for some sample server plug-ins intended for
use with the Fedora Directory Server 7.  

    NOTE: Before you compile and run these examples, make sure 
    to change any server-specific data in the examples to  
    values applicable to your Directory Server.

testbind.c
----------
This is an example of a pre-operation bind plug-in function that
handles authentication.  When processing an LDAP bind request, the
server calls this plug-in function before calling the database bind
function.

testentry.c
-----------
This is an example of an entry store plug-in function and an entry fetch
plug-in function.  You must be using the default database (not your own
back-end database) in order for these plug-in functions to work.

testextendedop.c
----------------
This is an example of an extended operation plug-in function that 
handles requests for the extended operation with the OID 1.2.3.4.
The example should be used in conjunction with the reqextop.c and
ReqExtOp.java clients (the source code for these clients is located
in the clients subdirectory).  These clients are capable of requesting 
the extended operation with the OID 1.2.3.4.

testpostop.c
------------
This contains examples of post-operation plug-in functions.  These 
functions are called after the server processes LDAP operations. 
The functions log changes to the directory in a change log file.  

testpreop.c
-----------
This contains examples of pre-operation plug-in functions.  These
functions are called before the server processes LDAP operations.

testsaslbind.c
--------------
This is an example of a pre-operation plug-in function that 
implements a SASL mechanism.

clients
-------
This directory contains the C and Java source code for clients
that you can use to test the server plug-ins.  See the README
file in that directory for details.


                     ----------------------------
                            How To Create
                           A Server Plug-In
                     ----------------------------

Text between brackets ([]) should be replaced with values specific to
your situation.


Creating the Plug-In Library
----------------------------
Server plug-ins are built as libraries available to the server.

1. Include the Plug-In API. For example:

   #include "[serverRoot]/plugins/slapd/slapi/include/slapi-plugin.h"

2. Write your plug-in, including a top level initialization function
   used by the server to start the plug-in. For example:

   /* Plug-in functions defined here */

   int my_plugin_init( Slapi_PBlock *pb ) /* initialize param. block */
   {
        /* Set or get the parameters in pb */
        slapi_pblock_set();
        slapi_pblock_get();

        /* Plug-in functions registered here */

        if (error)
           {
              slapi_log_error();
              return error_code;
           }
        else return 0;

   } /* my_plugin_init() */

   See the Parameter Block Reference in the Netscape Directory Server
   Plug-In Programmer's Guide for hints on plug-in types.

3. Build the plug-in as a library.

   We recommend you copy and adapt the Makefile in
   [serverRoot]/plugins/slapd/slapi/examples.


Plugging the Library Into the Server
------------------------------------
When started, the server loads plug-ins.

1. Stop the server.

   Console:      Select the server; Object > Stop Server
   Command Line: cd [serverRoot]/slapd-[serverID] ; ./stop-slapd

2. Add the entry for the server plug-in to
   [serverRoot]/slapd-[serverID]/config/dse.ldif. For example:

   dn: cn=[My Server Plugin],cn=plugins,cn=config
   objectClass: top
   objectClass: nsSlapdPlugin
   objectClass: extensibleObject
   cn: [My Server Plugin]
   nsslapd-pluginPath: [[serverRoot]/myPlugins/myveryown-plugin.so]
   nsslapd-pluginInitfunc: [my_plugin_init]
   nsslapd-pluginType: [myPluginType]
   nsslapd-pluginEnabled: on
   nsslapd-pluginarg0: [uid]
   nsslapd-pluginarg1: [mail]
   nsslapd-pluginarg2: [...]
   nsslapd-plugin-depends-on-type: [anotherPluginType]
   nsslapd-pluginId: [MyFirstServerPlugin]
   nsslapd-pluginVersion: [0.1]
   nsslapd-pluginVendor: [Fictional Software Company Incorporated]
   nsslapd-pluginDescription: [Add lots of cool functionality]

   See the Parameter Block Reference in the Netscape Directory Server
   Plug-In Programmer's Guide for hints on plug-in types.

3. Restart the server.

   Console:      Object > Start Server
   Command Line: cd [serverRoot]/slapd-[serverID] ; ./restart-slapd
