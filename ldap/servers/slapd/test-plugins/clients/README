                    Sample LDAP Clients That
                    Work with Server Plug-Ins 
                   ---------------------------

This directory contains code for some sample LDAP clients intended for
use with the sample server plug-ins.  For example, one of the server
plug-ins handles requests for an extended operation with the OID 1.2.3.4.
In order to test this sample plug-in, you need an LDAP v3 client that is
capable of requesting this extended operation.

    NOTE: Before you compile and run these examples, make sure 
    to change the server name, port number, root DN, and root DN 
    password to values applicable to your Directory Server.

reqextop.c
----------
This is an example of an LDAP client that requests extended operations.
The example should be used in conjunction with the testexop.c server
plug-in, which handles the extended operation with the OID 1.2.3.4.

This example requires a version of the Netscape Directory SDK that supports
the LDAP v3 protocol.  The 3.0 Beta version of the Directory SDK for C 
supports LDAP v3 and is available at the following location:
