Changelog user documentation
Last Updated October 6, 2000

1. Introduction

This document describes a how DS 6.0 provides a change log broadly 
compatible with the Internet Draft draft-good-ldap-changelog-01.txt.

When enabled, the change log appears in the DIT below cn=changelog. It 
consists of a single level of entries, each of class changeLogEntry.  This
object class allows the following attributes:
 - changeNumber. This attribute is always present and contains a single
   value, an integer which is unique for each change.  The value for later
   changes is larger than those of any change which is already present.
 - targetDN.  This attribute contains the distinguished name of the entry
   which was added, modified or deleted.  In the case of a ModifyDN operation,
   the targetDN attribute contains the DN of the entry before it was renamed
   or moved.
 - changeType. This attribute contains one of the following values: "add",
   "delete", "modify" or "modrdn".
 - changes.  This attribute contains the changes made to the entry, in LDIF
   format, for a add or modify change.  
 - newRDN.  This attribute contains the new RDN of the entry, for a modifyDN
   change.
 - deleteOldRDN.  This attribute contains whether the old RDN of the entry
   was deleted, for a modifyDN change.
 - newSuperior.  This attribute contains the newSuperior field of the entry,
   for a modifyDN change.

The change log is implemented in an LDBM database.

2. Configuration

To enable the change log, the following steps should be performed.  First, 
change the nsslapd-pluginenabled attribute of the DSE cn=Retrocl Plugin, 
cn=plugins,cn=config to "on" instead of "off", Then start or restart the 
server.  The server will automatically create the change log database.  

3. Trimming

The entries in the change log may be automatically removed if they are older
than a specified period of time.  This is done by setting the 
changelogmaximumage attribute in the change log plugin DSE cn=Retrocl Plugin, 
cn=plugins,cn=config and restarting the server.  If this attribute is not
present, then changed are not trimmed.

The changelogmaximumage attribute is single-valued, and its value consists of
two parts: a number and a time units code.  The time units codes are:
 - 's' for seconds,
 - 'm' for minutes,
 - 'h' for hours,
 - 'd' for days,
 - 'w' for weeks.

For example, 

changelogmaximumage: 2d

The minimum value is 5 minutes.

4. Access Control

When the changelog backend is created, the default access control is to allow 
anonymous read, search and compare to the changelog base entry, cn=changelog,
by anyone.  No access is granted, except implicitly to the Directory Manager, 
to any of the entries in the change log. 

Read access to the entries in the change log should not be granted to anonymous
users, as the changes attribute could contain modifications to sensitive 
attribute values (such as passwords).  Only authenticated services should be
allowed to access this information.

5. Protocol interaction

All search and compare operations are supported on the change log database.
Search operations whose filter is of the form 
(&(changenumber>=X)(changeNumber<=Y) are optimized. 

Add or modify operations should not be performed on change log entries in the 
change log database.  Change log entries can be deleted if desired.  The 
change log base entry, cn=changelog, can be modified if desired, to vary the
access control policy of the change log database.

6. Caveats

The change log does not currently record changes which are internally 
constructed to resolve conflicts during multi-master replication.  As a 
result, the change log should not be used in deployments which use multi-master
replication with more than two masters or suppliers for a database.
