PAM pass through authentication plugin for Directory Server

Introduction

Many organizations have authentication mechanisms
already in place. They may not want to have the LDAP server be the
central repository for authentication credentials and the
authentication mechanism. The typical deployment would use PAM as the
gateway to authentication. They do want to have many apps use the LDAP
server for authentication and for authorization, user information,
etc., just not as the authoritative data source for
credentials. GSS/SASL is typically used for this e.g. for Kerberos,
you can use your ticket to authenticate to the DS - the DS "passes
through" the authentication to Kerberos. But many apps cannot (or will
not) use SASL as their authentication mechanism - they must use simple
cleartext password BINDs. For these applications, it would be very
useful to have the DS pass through the auth creds to PAM.

BIND Preoperation Plugin for PAM

The PAM BIND Preoperation Plugin intercepts the BIND request and uses
the PAM API to authenticate the user.

If PAM supports password expiration or creation, how to handle that
with LDAP? Use standard LDAP mechanisms for password expiration
handling? Should probably make this configurable - ignore and error
out vs. sending back an appropriate control or error code.

Configuration

The administrator must be able to configure the following options in
the plugin. These are the attributes of the objectclass pamConfig
which is one of the objectclasses of the plugin entry:

* subtrees (list of DNs) - suffixes and/or subtrees to which this applies
      o pamExcludeSuffix - suffixes to be excluded from checking
      o pamIncludeSuffix - suffixes to be included in checking and exclude all others
      o excludes "win" in case of duplicates
      o default is to apply to all suffixes if no includes or excludes are specified 
* pamMissingSuffix (string)
      o ERROR: error and abort if excluded or included suffix does not exist
      o ALLOW (default): warn if exclude or include is missing, but continue
      o IGNORE: allow missing suffixes and don't log error 
* pamFallback (boolean) - if false, if PAM auth fails, the BIND
	operation fails. If true, if PAM auth fails, the DS will attempt other
	BIND mechanisms e.g. userPassword.
* pamSecure (boolean) - if true, a secure connection is required
* pamIDAttr (string) - The value of this attribute, present in the
	user's entry, holds the PAM identity of the user - it maps the LDAP
	identity to the PAM identity
* pamIDMapMethod (string)
      o RDN (default) - uses the value from the leftmost RDN in the BIND DN
      o ENTRY - gets the value of the PAM identity attribute from the BIND DN entry
      o DN - uses the full DN string
      o NOTE: if ENTRY is specified as the method, pamIDAttr must
		be set in the plugin config entry, and user entries should have the
		named attribute
* pamService (string) - the service argument to pam_start()
* others to keep statistics - TBD 

Design

BIND -> this plugin -> get config -> make sure arguments and state
conform to config settings -> pam_start() -> pam handshakes -> get
auth status -> pam_end() -> report BIND status back to LDAP client

The big problem is - how to map the BIND DN to the user name given to
pam_start(). There are a couple of different ways to do this. One way
is to just use the value part of the leftmost RDN in the BIND DN
e.g. if you bound as uid=richm,ou=people,dc=redhat,dc=com, you would
pass "richm" to PAM. Another way is to specify some attribute that
must exist in the user's entry and use that value e.g. if my entry
looks like this:

dn: uid=richm,ou=people,dc=redhat,dc=com
...
objectclass: inetOrgPerson
objectclass: redHatOrgPerson # has the extra attr
...
rhuid: rmeggins
...

"rhuid" would be specified in the PAM plugin config. When I bind as
uid=richm, the plugin would look up my entry, get the value of the
"rhuid" attribute, and use that value for PAM.

The password is the same password passed in as the BIND credentials.

We do not need to worry about PAM sessions - all we want to do is use
PAM to verify the auth creds. However, we could implement sessions -
we could do a pam_open_session() upon bind success and a
pam_close_session() upon rebind, unbind, closure, or
shutdown. However, this adds considerable complexity - must persist
the pam_handle_t throughout the connection (probably in a connection
extension), must ensure thread safe access to connection extension
resources, must ensure clean up in a variety of situations. So, best
to avoid it if possible.

We may have to worry about different PAM policy in different subtrees
e.g. maybe for dc=coke,dc=com you want to use the ENTRY map method,
but for dc=pepsi,dc=com you want to use the RDN method. We could
probably do this by having the pamIDMapMethod attr be multivalued, and
have it's value like this:

pamIDMapMethod: RDN dc=coke,dc=com
pamIDMapMethod: RDN dc=sprite,dc=com
pamIDMapMethod: ENTRY dc=pepsi,dc=com
pamIDMapMethod: DN (the default for all other suffixes)

The suffix that uses that map method would follow the map method used.

We need to worry about account expiration or lockout e.g. the user's
credentials are valid but the user has been locked out of his/her
account, or the password has expired, or something like that. Some of
this can be handled by LDAP e.g. returning password policy control
values when the password has expired. So we need to call
pam_acct_mgmt() somewhere during the pam handshakes and before
pam_end() to get this information. We also try to return an
appropriate LDAP error code.
PAM Error Code			LDAP Error Code				Meaning
PAM_USER_UNKNOWN		LDAP_NO_SUCH_OBJECT			User ID does not exist
PAM_AUTH_ERROR			LDAP_INVALID_CREDENTIALS	Password is not correct
PAM_ACCT_EXPIRED		LDAP_INVALID_CREDENTIALS	User's password is expired
PAM_PERM_DENIED			LDAP_UNWILLING_TO_PERFORM	User's account is locked out
PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD	LDAP_INVALID_CREDENTIALS	User's password has expired and must be renewed
PAM_MAXTRIES			LDAP_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION	Max retry count has been exceeded
Other codes				LDAP_OPERATIONS_ERROR		PAM config is incorrect, machine problem, etc.
There are three controls we might possibly add to the response:
* the auth response control - returned upon success - contains the BIND DN (u: not currently supported)
* LDAP_CONTROL_PWEXPIRED - returned when PAM reports ACCT_EXPIRED or NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD
* the new password policy control - returned when PAM reports
	ACCT_EXPIRED, NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD, PERM_DENIED, MAXTRIES The controls can
	be used to get more information in the case of error (password
	incorrect or expired?).

The latter two must be requested by the client.

The plugin should report status in attributes of the plugin entry
e.g. successfuls auth attempts, failed attempts, last pam error code
and message, etc. We could also do this in an entry under
cn=monitor. TBD.

Configuration

1. Shutdown the server
2. Make sure the slapd-instance/config/schema contains the 60pam-config.ldif file
3. Make sure serverroot/lib/pam-passthru-plugin.so exists
4. Make sure /etc/pam.d/ldapserver exists and is configured correctly
5. If the configuration is not already in dse.ldif, append the following to slapd-instance/config/dse.ldif

dn: cn=PAM Pass Through Auth,cn=plugins,cn=config
objectclass: top
objectclass: nsSlapdPlugin
objectclass: extensibleObject
objectclass: pamConfig
cn: PAM Pass Through Auth
nsslapd-pluginpath: /opt/ldapserver/lib/pam-passthru-plugin.so
nsslapd-plugininitfunc: pam_passthruauth_init
nsslapd-plugintype: preoperation
nsslapd-pluginenabled: on
nsslapd-pluginLoadGlobal: true
nsslapd-plugin-depends-on-type: database
pamMissingSuffix: ALLOW
pamExcludeSuffix: o=NetscapeRoot
pamExcludeSuffix: cn=config
pamIDMapMethod: RDN
pamFallback: FALSE
pamSecure: TRUE
pamService: ldapserver

Make sure there is a blank line at the end. The line with
o=NetscapeRoot may be omitted if this is not a configuration DS. Then
restart slapd.
