/*
 * Callbacks called when acquiring a replica
 *
 * The pre and post callbacks are called on the sending (master) side.
 * The receive and reply callbacks are called on the receiving (replica)
 * side.
 *
 * Data can be exchanged between the sending and receiving sides using
 * these callbacks by using the data_guid and data parameters.  The data
 * guid is used as an identifier to confirm the data type.  Your callbacks
 * that receive data must consult the data_guid before attempting to read
 * the data parameter. This allows you to confirm that the same replication
 * session plug-in is being used on both sides before making assumptions
 * about the format of the data. The callbacks use these parameters as
 * follows:
 *
 *   pre - send data to replica
 *   recv - receive data from master
 *   reply - send data to master
 *   post - receive data from replica
 *
 * The memory used by data_guid and data should be allocated in the pre
 * and reply callbacks.  The replication plug-in is responsible for
 * freeing this memory, so they should not be free'd in the callbacks.
 *
 * The return value of the callbacks should be 0 to allow replication
 * to continue. A non-0 return value will cause the replication session
 * to be abandoned, causing the master to go into incremental backoff
 * mode.
