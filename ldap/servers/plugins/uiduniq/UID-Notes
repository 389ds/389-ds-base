Unique UID Checking Plugin
--------------------------

Terry Hayes, April 16, 1998


GOALS

The Unique UID Checking Plugin supports the management of user entries in the
directory by enforcing the constraints on the value of an attribute within a
portion of the directory.  This provides a central point for enforcing this
constraint, which allows changes from any source to be checked (DSGW, Kingpin,
LDAP utilities, or user application).

CONFIGURATION

The software operates as a preoperation plugin to the directory server.  An
entry must be added to the slapd.conf file for the server that declares the
plugin and provides arguments required for its operation.

The plugin is declared as follows (line split for clarity):

  plugin preoperation "uid uniqueness" /home/thayes/testdir/lib/uid-plugin.so
    uidunique_init <attribute_name> <subtree_dn> ... 

The first 5 values are the standard plugin declaration.  The uidunique_init
function registers preoperation callbacks for the add, modify and modRDN
directory operations.

The next argument ("attribute_name") specifies the name of the entry attribute
to check for uniqueness.  This attribute must be unique within each of the
subtrees listed in the remainder of the arguments.

For example:

  plugin preoperation "uid uniqueness" /home/thayes/testdir/lib/uid-plugin.so
    uidunique_init uid o=mcom.com

This line specifies "uid" as the unique attribute, and lists a single subtree
to be checked.  This line is typical of an initial installation (see below).

A more complex case:

  plugin preoperation "uid uniqueness" /home/thayes/testdir/lib/uid-plugin.so
    uidunique_init uid o=Coke o=Pepsi
  plugin preoperation "uid uniqueness" /home/thayes/testdir/lib/uid-plugin.so
    uidunique_init mail "o=Dr. Pepper"

This configuration specifies a total of three subtrees to check.  Two use the
(standard) "uid" attribute as a unique value.  The other specifies "mail"
as the unique attribute.

INSTALLATION

The standard installation of the directory server will configure this plugin
to check the "uid" attribute on the default suffix.

OPERATION

The plugin responds to the following LDAP operations:

  + add
  + modify
  + modRDN

For all operations, the plugin forces the LDAP operation to return
CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION if the operation would result in two entries with
the same unique attribute value.

For an "add" operation that includes the unique attribute, the plugin checks
that no other entry has the same value.

For a "modify" operation, the operation will fail if the new value of the
attribute exists in any entry OTHER than the target of the modify.  If the
value already exists, but is in the node being changed, the operation
succeeds.  For example, if a modify operation replaces a 'uid' attribute
with the same set of values, the plugin will find the "new" values already
exist.  However since it is in the entry being modified, the operation is
allowed to complete.

For modRDN, the same checking as for "modify" is performed.

ModRDN is coded to handle reparenting, but since the LDAP protocol to support
this operation is not present, it cannot be exercised and has not been
tested.
