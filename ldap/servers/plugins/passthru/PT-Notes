    n	nice-to-have
    ?	undecided whether this is a good idea or not

Missing features:
n    U/I for configuration.

Loose ends:
n   Resolve any remaining code that is marked with XXX.
n   Put some thought into cases we do not handle (SASL, no DN, no passwd) and
	make sure we do the right thing in terms of errors, letting server's
	standard mechanism handle the bind, etc.
?   Protect against server connecting back to itself recursively.

Testing:
r    Basic tests (all platforms: NT,Sol,IRIX,AIX,HP/UX,OSF/1).
r    Controls (both coming (e.g., ?) and going (e.g., password policy).
r    SSL connections to remote servers.
r    LDAPv2/v3 compatiblity
r    Stress tests.
