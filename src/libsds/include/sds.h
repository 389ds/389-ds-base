/**
 * \defgroup sds_bptree_cow SDS Copy on Write B+Tree
 * Thread safe Copy of Write B+Tree. Supports parallel read transactions and serialised writes with ref counted members.
 *
 * This is a very important structure, and is the primary reason to consume this library. There are a number of important properties
 * that this tree provides.
 *
 * A key concept of this structure is that all values and keys contained have their lifetimes bound to the life of the tree and it's
 * nodes. This is due to the transactional nature of the structure. Consider a value that has been inserted into the tree. We take a
 * read transaction of the tree in thread A. Thread B now deletes the value that was inserted. Because A still refers to the value,
 * it is not freed until thread A closes it's read transaction. This guarantees that all read transactions are always valid, while
 * also maintaining that memory can be freed correctly. This has many applications including the Directory Server plugin subsystem.
 * We can use this property to guarantee a plugin exists for the life of an operation, and we only free it once all consumers have
 * completed their operations with it.
 *
 * Another key aspect of this tree is that write transactions *do not* block read transactions. Reads can be completed in parallel
 * to writes with complete safety. Write operations are serialised in this structure. This makes the structure extremely effective
 * for long read operations with many queries, without interrupting other threads.
 *
 * Along with the value and key ownership properties, we can guarantee that the content of the tree within a read transaction
 * will *not* be removed or added and will be consistent within the tree (however, we can't guarantee a user doesn't change the value.)
 *
 * As a comparison, the single thread tree is on paper, much faster than the COW version due to less memory operations. However in a
 * multi thread use case, the COW version is signifigantly faster *and* safer than a mutex protected single thread tree.
 *
 * This tree can be used as a form of object manager for C, as well as a way to allow async operations between threads while maintaining,
 * thread safety across an application. This assumes that the operations are largely parallel and batch read oriented over write heavy small
 * transactions.

/**
 * The copy on write tree instance. This stores the current active reading
 * transaction, number of active transactions, and pointers to the root of the
 * b+tree.
 *
 * This instance is the most important part of the tree and provides us with memory safety. Once we
 * have memory safety, individual transactions are free to garbage collect on their own. Garbage collection
 * is coordinated from the instance.
 *
 * ## MEMORY SAFTEY
 *
 * Within the transaction, we have a small number of important fields. These are:
 *
 * - read_lock
 * - write_lock
 * - tail_txn
 *
 * ### Read Transaction Begin
 *
 * At the beginning of a read transaction, we take a rolock on read_lock. This ensures that on
 * our working thread, that the correct sequence of barriers for memory consistency of the tree
 * is issued.
 *
 * Within the read_lock, we use cpu atomics to increment the transaction reference count by 1.
 * We then release the read_lock.
 *
 * In this way, we allow multiple read transactions to be initiated at the same time, with the
 * only serialisation point being the atomic increment.
 *
 * While the read transaction is "active" (IE the transaction that is listed in binst, where new
 * transactions will reference), the reference count will never go below 1.
 *
 * ### Write Transaction
 *
 * At the beginning of a write transaction, we take the write_lock mutex. This guarantees we are
 * the only writer in the tree at a point in time. Due to the way mutexes work, this guarantees
 * our memory barries of the tree are issued, so we see all other writes that have occured.
 *
 * During a write, we store a list of all nodes that were cloned: Both so that we know who we cloned
 * *from* but aso what nodes we *created*.
 *
 * ### Write Abort
 *
 * During a write abort, we release the write lock immediately. We then use the created node list, and
 * free all contents as they were never made active.
 *
 * ### Write commit
 *
 * During a commit, we prepare the transaction by changing it's state flags, and setting it's reference
 * count atomically. We relinquish the created list, because we have no need to free the nodes that are
 * about to become part of the tree. However, we update the previous transaction with the "owned" list,
 * as these are nodes we cloned from: IE these are nodes that serve no *future* role in the tree, so the
 * previous transaction is the last point where they are valid and needed - The last transaction now must
 * clean up after itself when it's ready to GC!
 *
 * We set our reference count to 2, to indicate that a following node (the previous active transaction)
 * relies on us, and that we are also active.
 *
 * We now take the write variant of the rw read_lock. This waits for all in progress read transactions to
 * begin, and we take exclusive access of this lock. We then pivot the older transaction out with our
 * transaction. The read_lock is released, and read transactions may now resume.
 *
 * At this point, we release the write_lock, and a new write may begin.
 *
 * We decrement the reference count of the previous transaction which may cause it to drop to 0. This is
 * the equivalent of a read transaction close. After this point, the previous transactions reference
 * count will only decrement, as previous holders close their transactions. Increment only occurs from the
 * active transaction!
 *
 * ### Read transaction close.
 *
 * When we close a read transaction, we require no locks. We use cpu atomic to set and fetch the
 * reference count.
 *
 * If the reference count remains positive, we complete, and continue.
 *
 * If the reference count drops to 0, we take a reference to the next transaction in the series,
 * and we free our node. We then decrement the reference counter of the next transaction and check
 * the result.
 *
 * Either, the reference count is > 0 because it is the active transaction *or* there is a current
 * read transaction.
 *
 * OR, the reference count reaches 0 because there are no active transactions, so we can free this node.
 * in the same operation, we then decrement the reference count to the next node in the series,
 * and we repeat this til we reach a node with a positive reference count.
 *
 * Due to the design of this system, we are guarantee no thread races, as one and only one thread
 * can ever set the reference count to 0: either the closing read, or the closing previous transaction.
 * This gives us complete thread safety, but without the need for a mutex to ensure this.
 *
 * ### Usage of the memory safe properties.
 *
 * Due to the way the barriers are issued, when you have a read transaction or a write transaction, you can
 * guarantee that the tree memory is consistent and correct, and that all values will remain alive until
 * you close the transaction. This means you can use this to allow parallel tasks in complex cases. Directory
 * Server has such a case with the plugin subsystem. Consider every operation needs a consistent list of plugins.
 *
 * You build a tree of the plugin references  (dlopen pointers, reference count, pblock) and store them.
 *
 * When you begin the operation you take a read transaction of this. This means every plugin in the operation is
 * guaranteed to be in the tree and held open for the duration of this operation. During the read, if another thread
 * commits the delete on a plugin, this drops the ref count, but not below 0 - the operation can continue safely.
 *
