# nunc-stans

Nunc Stans is an event framework wrapper that provides a thread pool for event callback execution. It provides thread safety to event frameworks by isolating and protecting the thread safe parts from the non-thread safe parts, and allows multi-threaded applications to use event frameworks that are not thread safe.

It has been primarily developed using http://libevent.org .
