Welcome to lib389's documentation!
==================================

Lib389 is a python base library for managing Directory servers.
It was initially created to help writing tests of DS. It can also used
to create new administration CLIs. This document is focusing on writing
tests for the Directory Server. Lib389 can be used to generate individual
testcases(tickets), and suites that test a range of functionality/feature.
